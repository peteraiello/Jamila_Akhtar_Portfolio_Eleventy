    blurb: "<p>A designer with a slight obsession for colour and deep fascination for transitional/liminal spaces (probably due to my Third Culture Kid upbringing and my Interior Design background). My work concentrates on crafting beautiful pieces of art by blending structure with purpose; I merge strategy with visual direction to infuse design with meaning.</p>
    <p>My life story takes me on adventures through the U.A.E. and the UK, but now I am back in my home country of Canada where it all began.</p>
    <p>Beyond design, I can be found with my nose deep in a book, doing sudoku, getting lost in some type of arts or crafts, dancing the day away, baking delicious sweet treats or being outdoors where I will either be wandering on a hike, submerged in the ocean or galivanting through a botanical garden.</p>
